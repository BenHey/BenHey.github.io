I am a Staff Research Scientist at Criteo with interests in game theory, reinforcement learning and causal methods. 
I am a member of the join Inria/Criteo FairPlay team. 

My work is motivated by applications for recommender systems and marketplace design.
I try to dedicate time to both applied and theoretical topics. 

I am currently based in Montreal, but I am usually in Paris. 

I hold a degree in  engineering from the Ecole polytechnique (Paris), a Master of Science in Operations Research from Columbia University (New York) and a PhD in applied mathematics from the Ecole polytechnique/Inria. 

I was honoured to receive a Siebel Scholarship in 2016.

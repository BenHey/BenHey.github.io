We first provide an algorithm based on Knaster-Tarski's fixed point theorem to solve the allocation problem in the quadratic losses case. We then identify a monotony condition on the types distribution under which the Bayesian cost minimizing mechanism takes a simple form.}

We use this efficient algorithm to compare optimal, first-price and VCG auctions. This allows us to numerically estimate the social cost of sub-optimality of the nodal pricing mechanism in wholesale electricity markets. We also derive a closed form expression of the optimal mechanism procurement cost when the types are uniformly distributed.}},

  abstract = {{The effectiveness of advertising in e-commerce largely depends on the ability of merchants to bid on and win impressions for their targeted users. The bidding procedure is
highly complex due to various factors such as market competition, user behavior, and the diverse objectives of advertisers. In this paper we consider the problem at the level of user
timelines instead of individual bid requests, manipulating full
policies (i.e. pre-defined bidding strategies) and not bid values. In order to optimally allocate policies to users, typical
multiple treatments allocation methods solve knapsack-like
problems which aim at maximizing an expected value under
constraints. In the industrial contexts such as online advertising, we argue that optimizing for the probability of success
is a more suited objective than expected value maximization,
and we introduce the SuccessProbaMax algorithm that
aims at finding the policy allocation which is the most likely
to outperform a fixed reference policy. Finally, we conduct
comprehensive experiments both on synthetic and real-world
data to evaluate its performance. The results demonstrate that
our proposed algorithm outperforms conventional expectedvalue maximization algorithms in terms of success rate.}}

    abstract = { Problem definition: Most of the display advertising inventory is sold through real-time auctions. The participants of these auctions are typically bidders (Google, Criteo, RTB House, and Trade Desk for instance) that participate on behalf of advertisers. In order to estimate the value of each display opportunity, they usually train advanced machine learning algorithms using historical data. In the labeled training set, the inputs are vectors of features representing each display opportunity, and the labels are the generated rewards. In practice, the rewards are given by the advertiser and are tied to whether a particular user converts. Consequently, the rewards are aggregated at the user level and never observed at the display level. A fundamental task that has, to the best of our knowledge, been overlooked is to account for this mismatch and split, or attribute, the rewards at the right granularity level before training a learning algorithm. We call this the label attribution problem. Methodology/results: In this paper, we develop an approach to the label attribution problem, which is both theoretically justified and practical. In particular, we develop a fixed point algorithm that allows for large-scale implementation and showcase our solution using a large-scale publicly available data set from Criteo, a large demand-side platform. We dub our approach the fixed point label attribution algorithm. Managerial implications: There is often a hidden leap of faith when transforming the advertiser’s signal into display labeling. Demand Side Platforms providers should be careful when building their machine learning pipeline and carefully solve the label attribution step. }
